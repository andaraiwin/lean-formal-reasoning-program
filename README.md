# frap (Formal Reasoning About Programming)

## Course Description
How do civil engineers ensure that a bridge being constructed will not crumble?  They use rigorous mathematics to calculate the appropriate values of parameters, plus some margin for additional tolerance.  How do computer engineers like us ensure that software being written will not misbehave?  Do we have the same rigor to be confident like with civil engineers?

We usually rely on software testing to establish some confidence with the correctness of a program.  To be absolutely certain, however, a proof of correctness must be given.  Traditional proofs are done on paper, without a guarantee whether they are correct.  In this course, we will learn how to use a _proof assistant_ that checks for the validity of a proof, how to write proofs that can be machine-checked, and how to encode computational models and programming language semantics so that we can prove their properties.  Furthermore, we will study several formal systems that can be used to explain correctness of programs.
